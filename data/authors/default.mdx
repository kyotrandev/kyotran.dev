## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving-hand" /> I'm Tran Quang Dieu (aka Kyo)

I have a passion for **JavaScript/Typescript** and website development.
I'm currently a fullstack developer at **YouNet Media**, deeply engaged in the **EcomHeat** project, which entails market share management, competitor research, and fostering e-commerce growth.
I work mainly with **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **React**, **NodeJS**, **NestJS**, and **NextJS**.

## Why have this blog?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow web developers.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
